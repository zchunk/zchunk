(ci)
 Compressed (unsigned) integer - An variable length little endian
 integer where the first seven bits of the number are stored in the
 first byte, followed by the next seven bits in the next byte, and so
 on.  The top bit of all bytes except the final byte must be zero, and
 the top bit of the final byte must be one, indicating the end of the
 number.

ID
 '\0ZCK1', identifies file as zchunk version 1 file

Flags
 32 bits for flags.  All unused flags MUST be set to 0.  If a decoder sees
 a flag set that it doesn't recognize, it MUST exit with an error.  Flags

 Current flags are:
  bit 0: File has data streams

Checksum type
 This is an integer containing the type of checksum used to generate the
 header checksum and the total data checksum, but *not* the chunk checksums.

 Current values:
   0 = SHA-1
   1 = SHA-256

Header checksum
 This is the checksum of everything from the beginning of the file
 until the end of the index, ignoring the header checksum.

Compression type
 This is an integer containing the type of compression used to
 compress dict and chunks.

 Current values:
   0 - Uncompressed
   2 - zstd

Index size
 This is an integer containing the size of the index.

Index
 This is the index, which is described in the next section.

Signature size
 This is an integer countaining the size of the signature section.

Signatures
 These are the signatures, described in a later section.

Compressed Dict (optional)
 This is a custom dictionary used when compressing each chunk.
 Because each chunk is compressed completely separately from the
 others, the custom dictionary gives us much better overall
 compression.  The custom dictionary is compressed without a custom
 dictionary (for obvious reasons).

Chunk
 This is a chunk of data, compressed with the custom dictionary
 provided above.


The index:

+==========================+==================+===============+
| Chunk checksum type (ci) | Chunk count (ci) | Data checksum |
+==========================+==================+===============+

+==================+===============+==================+
| Dict stream (ci) | Dict checksum | Dict length (ci) |
+==================+===============+==================+

+===============================+
| Uncompressed dict length (ci) |
+===============================+

+===================+================+===================+
| Chunk stream (ci) | Chunk checksum | Chunk length (ci) |
+===================+================+===================+

+==========================+
| Uncompressed length (ci) | ...
+==========================+

Chunk checksum type
 This is an integer containing the type of checksum used to generate
 the chunk checksums.

 Current values:
   0 = SHA-1
   1 = SHA-256

Chunk count
 This is a count of the number of chunks in the zchunk file.

Checksum of all data
 This is the checksum of everything after the index, including the
 compressed dict and all the compressed chunks.  This checksum is
 generated using the overall checksum type, *not* the chunk checksum
 type.

Dict stream
 If the data streams flag is set, this must always be 0, otherwise don't
 include this integer

Dict checksum
 This is the checksum of the compressed dict, used to detect whether
 two dicts are identical.  If there is no dict, the checksum must be
 all zeros.

Dict length
 This is an integer containing the length of the dict.  If there is no
 dict, this must be a zero.

Uncompressed dict length
 This is an integer containing the length of the dict after it has
 been decompressed.  If there is no dict, this must be a zero.

Chunk stream
 If the data streams flag is set, this indicates which stream this chunk
 belongs to.  1 is the default, so decoders SHOULD decode stream 1 by default.
 If the data streams flag isn't set, don't include this integer.

Chunk checksum
 This is the checksum of the compressed chunk, used to detect whether
 any two chunks are identical.

Chunk length
 This is an integer containing the length of the chunk.

Uncompressed dict length
 This is an integer containing the length of the chunk after it has
 been decompressed.

The index is designed to be able to be extracted from the file on the
server and downloaded separately, to facilitate downloading only the
parts of the file that are needed, but must then be re-embedded when
assembling the file so the user only needs to keep one file.

Streams can be used to separate file metadata and data.  An example might be a
package format with the files stored in a tarball in stream 1, but the metadata
stored in stream 2.


The signatures:
+=====================+=====================+===========+
| Signature type (ci) | Signature size (ci) | Signature | ...
+=====================+=====================+===========+

Signature type
 This is an integer containing the type of signature.  Currently there are
 no recognized signature types.

Signature size
 This is an integer containing the size of the signature.

Signature
 The actual signature.  The signature MUST only apply to the header, excluding
 the header checksum, the signature count and the signatures.

Signatures are designed so that anyone can add a new signature to a file
without changing the validity of other signatures, but the header checksum
must be recalculated.

We only sign the header so the signature can be validated independently of the
data, though the data can then be validated through both the chunk checksums
and the full data checksum, both of which will be signed by the signatures.
